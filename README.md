### About Project
In this project we implement the popular game Score 4 on an FPGA. The project contains:
- Control Logic (FSM) for choosing, putting and winning for each player
- Panel Display, Showing the game .

The project also contains a testbench for all different scenarios and a module to save and see different frames of the final result. (the frame saving module in the testbench was given to us by the teachers)
